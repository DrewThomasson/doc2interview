## To-Do List

- [ ] **Attempt to find a way to remove any ramlbings at the end.**  
  For more details, see the issue request [here](https://github.com/DrewThomasson/doc2interview/issues/2#issue-2501722522).

- [ ] **Allow users to easily swap the ref audio for either voice actors in gui.**  

- [ ] **Find a way for the program to be able to determine which speakers in generated dialog are male or female.**  
  Possably by just asking the llm.

- [ ] **Allow user to see streaming llm outout**  
  Right now you cant see the llm working live in the terminal, and only see the llm output once its finished writing the dialog script.

- [ ] **Have program automatically run the ollama pull command if the specified model isnt found?**  
  Not that huge of an issue though.
